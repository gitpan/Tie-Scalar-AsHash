Tie-Scalar-AsHash 0.01

Tie::Scalar::AsHash is designed as a base class for hashref-based tied scalars.
Tie::StdScalar is similar, except it can only produced scalarref-based tied
scalars. Tie::Scalar doesn't actually give us anything, except letting us know
that we missed an important method.

You only need to override FETCH and STORE. You can also override BUILD to
set up the hashref. This means you no longer have to write TIESCALAR. :)
